# topoged-hibernate

The topoged-hibernate library is part of the larger topoged project.
Its purpose is to create a Clojure interface to Hibernate.  The goals
of this project are:

*  To remove all the boilerplate code.
*  Allow Hibernate configuration to be used as is.  There is no need
   to create a new configuration mechanism in Clojure; XML is just fine.
*  Allow for programatic configurarion.
*  Integrate with existing Clojure paradigms.
